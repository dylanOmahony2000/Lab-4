Organisation:

    I created the binary tree related functions in the BST.c 
File, the main function in Main.c uses these functions to
create a binary tree and insert items in to it. Once it has
inserted 10 unique items between 1 and 20 it searches to check if 
an item is in the BST using the find function in BST.c. If the item 
is found it prints that the item is found if not it says the item has 
not been found. you can change the item that it searches the BSt for by
changing the item variable in main. i also added a print tree function
that prints the structure of the tree from left to right not top to bottom,
so the left most item is the root node.

    i also created a make file to compile the project, and clean the directory, you
can use the make file to compile all files by entering "make" in to the terminal, then 
use "./main" to run the project."make clean" will clean the directory.

Github Branches:
    i created a branch for Master, Binary-search-tree- and makefile. i initially created 
a main function branch but deleted it as it was easier to create the main function in the 
binary-search-tree branch. i created the Main.c and BST.C in the binary-search-tree branch 
and merged this branch in to the master branch.I then created a makefile branch from master,
then created and tested the make file before merging the makefile branch in to master.
